3d Flight Sim that driffs off with placeholders for up-down-left-right keys, also a template for multiple ways of doing camera and movement in videogames.

Template:

1. No bounds are set(altitude can be negative, it can "go forward" forever, etc)
 
2. Options for movement
   
 A. Use Camera to Follow the 3d object
 B. Move enviorment around 3d object

4. Right-Left-Up-Down have placeholders that rotate the model.

5. Object accelerates endlessly
